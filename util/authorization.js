/**
 * This file is responsible for authorizing the state 
 * of a user on each request.
 * 
 * The state of user starts when they successfully sign in 
 * with google and should end when they log out or their 
 * sessions expires.
 * 
 * The full authorization process happens in a few steps:
 *    (note the difference between the jwt itself and the cookie that carries the jwt)
 *    (also note there are different methods for storing the JWTs but the JWT logic is usually the same)
 * 
 *  1) JWT is initially created after sign in, 
 * 
 *      it contains some data from the google sign in payload and expires in some small time frame (15min-1hour).
 *      After this expiration date, the JWT is regenrated ( see step below )
 *    
 *      The jwt is stored in a cookie by the browser. The cookie has a larger time frame (7days-1fortnight), 
 *      after which the JWT is not regenerated and the session expires (see last step)
 *   
 *  2)  On each request, the jwt cookie is checked.
 *    
 *       If the cookie is empty, the request is not processed, page may be redirected
 *       If jwt in cookie malformed, the request also fails. 
 *       If it's expired, a new jwt is generated in the cookie and request is processed
 *       If it's totally valid, request is processed
 * 
 *  3) After, the cookie that holds the JWT is expired, or the user signs out (clearing that cookie)
 *     their session has expired
 *
